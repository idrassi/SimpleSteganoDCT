## **1. Introduction**

Steganography is the practice of hiding data in a seemingly innocuous medium. With the rise of digital communication, image steganography remains one of the most popular forms of covert data exchange. The **SimpleSteganoDCT** Python program implements a **Quantization Index Modulation (QIM)** approach for embedding secret messages into the mid-frequency components of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of an image. The code is optimized to be more resilient to JPEG compression (at around 70% quality). It also includes **Reed-Solomon error correction** to improve robustness and reliability.

This document details every aspect of the system, including mathematical underpinnings, algorithmic steps, and potential limitations. It aims to be useful to researchers, security practitioners, and enthusiasts who want to explore or extend DCT-based steganography techniques.

## **2. Background and Motivation**

### **Why DCT for Steganography?**

The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is widely used in image processing and compression (e.g., JPEG). By transforming the spatial domain into a frequency domain, it enables selective manipulation of frequency components. This is beneficial in steganography for several reasons:

- **Frequency-Domain Embedding**: Alterations in specific frequency bands can be less noticeable to the human visual system.
- **Compression Compatibility**: Many modern compression algorithms (JPEG/MPEG) rely on DCT or similar transforms.
- **Noise-Like Embedding**: Frequency-domain modifications often appear as minor noise and are difficult to detect visually.

### **Why Mid-Frequency Components?**

Frequency components in a typical 8x8 DCT block are categorized as:

- **Low-Frequency**: Contains most of the image energy; modifying these heavily can cause visible distortions.
- **High-Frequency**: Susceptible to compression and noise; embedding bits here can lead to data loss or artifacts.
- **Mid-Frequency**: Offers a balance between perceptual transparency and stability under compression or slight modifications.

By embedding in the **mid-frequency** region, we aim to maintain a good balance between **imperceptibility** and **robustness**.

### **QIM-Based Embedding Rationale**

Instead of modifying the magnitude or flipping the sign of DCT coefficients, SimpleSteganoDCT approach uses **Quantization Index Modulation (QIM)**. In this method:

1. **Quantization Steps**: Each DCT coefficient is divided by a quantization step, yielding an integer index \(k\).  
2. **Bit Encoding via Parity**: If the bit to embed is '1', the integer index is forced to be odd; if the bit is '0', the index is forced to be even.  
3. **Reconstruction**: The modified coefficient is recalculated by multiplying the new integer index by the quantization step, thereby embedding the bit.

This QIM approach provides the following advantages:

1. **JPEG Robustness**: By aligning with the JPEG luminance quantization matrix, the embedding process can better survive subsequent JPEG compression.  
2. **Low Visual Impact**: Small, quantized coefficient changes can be less visually noticeable than repeated sign flips or large magnitude changes.  
3. **Efficient Bit Embedding**: Parity-based embedding avoids drastic coefficient modifications while ensuring each bit is consistently recoverable under mild compression or rounding.

### **High-Level Steps**

1. **Preprocessing**: Converts the input image from RGB to YCrCb color space to operate on the luminance (Y) channel.
2. **Block-Wise DCT**: Splits the Y channel into 8x8 blocks and calculates the DCT of each block.
3. **Message Encoding**: Encodes the secret text using Reed-Solomon and attaches a sync marker and length information.
4. **QIM-Based Embedding**: Alters the selected mid-frequency DCT coefficients according to the encoded bits.
5. **Reconstruction**: Performs the inverse DCT (iDCT) and merges the Y channel back with the CrCb channels to produce the final stego image.

---

## **4. Detailed Embedding Process**

### **Preprocessing**

1. **Color Space Conversion**: The input image, typically in RGB (or BGR in OpenCV), is converted to **YCrCb**.
2. **Block Partition**: The Y (luminance) channel is divided into blocks of size 8x8. Each block is processed independently.

### **DCT and Block Processing**

- For each 8x8 block \( B \), compute the 2D DCT:
  D = DCT(B)
- This results in a matrix \( D \) of DCT coefficients. 
- The implementation uses a fixed set of four mid-frequency coefficients at positions:
  - (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), and (3,3)
- These positions were chosen because they represent a good balance between:
  - Being far enough from the DC coefficient (0,0) to avoid visible distortions
  - Not being in the highest frequency region where data might be lost
  - Being adjacent to each other for implementation simplicity
```

```

### **Message Encoding and Reed-Solomon**

1. **Message Preparation**:
    - The text message is first combined with a sync marker (default `10101010`).
    - The combined string is encoded to UTF-8 bytes.
    - Reed-Solomon encoding is applied to this first part (encoded1)
2. **Length Encoding**:
    - The length of encoded1 is converted to 4 bytes (big-endian).
    - Reed-Solomon encoding is applied to these 4 bytes (encoded2).
3. **Final Payload**:
    - The final payload is the concatenation: encoded2 + encoded1.
    - This payload is ready for embedding into the DCT coefficients.

### **QIM-Based Coefficient Modification**

1. **Coefficient Selection**:  
   - Fixed mid-frequency positions are used: \((2,2)\), \((2,3)\), \((3,2)\), \((3,3)\).  
   - The redundancy parameter controls how many of these positions are used.

2. **Quantization Step**:  
   - A baseline quantization matrix, derived from the standard **JPEG Q=50** matrix, is scaled by a factor (\(0.6\) for Q=70).  
   - An additional **\(\alpha\)** parameter scales these steps further (e.g., \(\alpha = 1.5\)) to control the embedding strength.

3. **Embedding Each Bit**:  
   - For each bit b ∈ {0,1}:  
     1. Compute k = round(c / (α × q_base)), where c is the current DCT coefficient and q_base is the base quantization value for that coefficient's position.  
     2. Enforce parity: if b=1, make k odd; if b=0, make k even.  
     3. Reconstruct the coefficient as c' = k × (α × q_base).

4. **Inverse DCT**:  
   - The modified blocks are subjected to iDCT, and the resulting Y-channel is reassembled to form the stego image.

## **5. Detailed Extraction Process**

1. **Format Validation**
   - Validates input image is PNG format
   - Verifies PNG file signature

2. **Length Information Extraction**
   - Converts image to YCrCb and extracts Y channel
   - Processes 8x8 blocks with DCT
   - Extracts first payload (encoded2) containing length information
   - Applies Reed-Solomon decoding to get message length

3. **Message Extraction**
   - Continues processing DCT blocks
   - Extracts bits based on coefficient parity at positions [(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)]
   - Collects exactly the number of bits indicated by length information

4. **Message Reconstruction**
   - Applies Reed-Solomon decoding to extracted payload
   - Validates presence of sync marker ("10101010")
   - Removes sync marker to get final message
   - Converts bit stream to UTF-8 text

## **6. Error Correction with Reed-Solomon**

Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are block-based error correction codes capable of repairing multiple symbol errors.
They are crucial in this implementation to:

  - Protect both length information and message content
  - Recover from DCT coefficient quantization errors
  - Handle minor image modifications or noise
  - Ensure reliable message extraction

### **Implementation Structure**

- **RS Configuration:**: Uses `RSCodec` with a configurable error correction parameter (default: 20 symbols).
- **Two-Part Encoding Scheme**:
    - Length Information: 4 bytes encoded with RS to store the message length.
    - Message Content: The actual message (with sync marker) encoded with RS.

### **Error Correction Parameters**
- **Error Correction Capability**: Can correct up to `rs_error_correction/2` symbol errors per block
- **Overhead**: Each RS-encoded block includes parity bytes for error correction
    - Length encoding: 4 bytes → `get_rs_encoded_length()` bytes
    - Message encoding: message length → message length + parity bytes

### **Error Recovery Process**

1. Length Recovery:

    - Extracts and RS-decodes the length information first
    - If length recovery fails, the entire extraction fails

2. Message Recovery:

    - Uses recovered length to extract the correct number of encoded message bytes
    - RS decoding attempts to correct any errors in the message content
    - Sync marker validation ensures message integrity

## **7. Quality Assessment**

The implementation uses scikit-image's metrics to evaluate the quality of the steganographic embedding:

### **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**

PSNR = 10 * log10(MAX_IMAGE^2 / MSE)

- **MSE** is the Mean Squared Error between the original and stego images
- Higher PSNR values indicate less perceptible distortion
- Calculated across all color channels (RGB/BGR)
- Typical values for this implementation range from X to Y dB (actual ranges should be determined through testing)

### **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**

SSIM(x,y) = (2μxμy + c1)(2σxy + c2) / ((μx² + μy² + c1)(σx² + σy² + c2))

- **SSIM** models image degradation as perceived changes in structural information
- Values close to 1 indicate that the images are very similar
- Implementation uses multi-channel SSIM with channel_axis=2
- Typical values for this implementation range from X to Y (actual ranges should be determined through testing)

The metrics are calculated and printed after embedding. They provide a quantitative estimate of how embedding affects image quality. Higher PSNR and SSIM values indicate better steganographic quality with less noticeable artifacts.

With QIM-based embedding:
- **Distortions** are often controlled by \(\alpha\).  
- **Robustness** can be improved by increasing \(\alpha\) but at the cost of lower PSNR and SSIM.

## **8. Limitations**

1. **Capacity Constraints**: 
   - Maximum capacity per block = number of coefficient positions (default 4 positions per 8x8 block)
   - Total blocks = (image_height // 8) * (image_width // 8)
   - Effective capacity is reduced by:
     - Reed-Solomon encoding overhead (configurable via rs_error_correction, default 20 bytes)
     - Two-part encoding scheme:
       - Length information (4 bytes + RS encoding)
       - Sync marker (8 bytes) + actual message + RS encoding

2. **Visual Artifacts**: 
   - Primarily controlled by **\(\alpha\)** (embedding strength factor).  
   - Larger \(\alpha\) ensures stronger QIM embedding but can cause more artifacts.

3. **Format Restrictions**: 
   - Strictly requires PNG format output of embedding process

4. **Image Requirements**: 
   - Image dimensions must accommodate 8x8 DCT blocks
   - Sufficient quality needed for reliable DCT coefficient manipulation
   - No built-in validation for image quality or noise levels

5. **Security Considerations**: 
   - No cryptographic protection of hidden content
   - Fixed embedding positions in DCT blocks
   - Known sync marker and encoding scheme
   - Vulnerable to statistical steganalysis

## **9. Conclusion and Future Work**

The **SimpleStegano** system demonstrates an effective approach for embedding text into image DCT coefficients using a sign-based strategy. Its combination of **mid-frequency** embedding and **Reed-Solomon** error correction, along with a robust two-part payload structure (length encoding + message), yields a reliable steganographic mechanism with built-in error detection and correction capabilities.
